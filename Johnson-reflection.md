#Reflection

* I struggled with the git pull and get merge concepts as well as when to add origin and when not to add origin
* Git push and git merge were cleared up a lot during the GPS. Also using tab in terminal! 
* I asked about how to push files to github as well as how to move files into the repository. 
* Remember the order of the git commands is still a little blurry and the granular command entry is still difficult. 
* It was really great! Everyone was incredibly supportive even when things went bonkers for some reason!
